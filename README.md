NTHU CS. 10920 CS512000 VLSI System Design.

## hw1
- Train a simple CNN with post-training quantization.
- Get familiar with the PyTorch code

## hw2
- Model inference of the CNN pretrained in the hw1.
- Approach A, B: Reduce the bit-width of partial sums without hurting the accuracy.
- Approach C: Reduce the bit-width of partial sums **in each layer** without hurting the accuracy.
